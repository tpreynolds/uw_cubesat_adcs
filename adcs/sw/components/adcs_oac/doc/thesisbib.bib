abstract = {A complementarity framework is described for the modeling of certain classes of mixed continuous/discrete dynamical systems. The use of such a framework is well known for mechanical systems with inequality constraints, but we give a more general formulation which also applies, for instance, to switching control systems, The main theoretical results in the paper are concerned with uniqueness of smooth continuations; the solution of this problem requires the construction of a map from the continuous state to the discrete state, A crucial technical tool is the so-called linear complementarity problem (LCP) from mathematical programming; we introduce various generalizations of this problem.},

It proposes to$\backslash$nuse micro-PPTs to formation fly with two other student-built satellites$\backslash$nin a constellation known as ION-F. Dawgstar, planned for launch in 2001,$\backslash$nprovides a useful technology testbed for future micro- and nano-sat$\backslash$nefforts.

The PPT also offers a$\backslash$nvery high specific impulse compared to other candidate microthrusters.$\backslash$nThe fundamentals of the PPT propulsion system are described and a$\backslash$npreliminary layout of the concept is explained. Preliminary tests$\backslash$nresults from scaled configurations are presented. A key area for$\backslash$nminiaturization is the onboard electronics.

abstract = {Quaternions have been a popular tool in 3D computer graphics for more than 20 years. However, classical quaternions are restricted to the representation of rotations, whereas in graphical applications we typically work with rotation composed with translation (i.e., a rigid transformation). Dual quaternions represent rigid transformations in the same way as classical quaternions represent rotations. In this paper we show how to generalize established techniques for blending of rotations to include all rigid transformations. Algorithms based on dual quaternions are computationally more effi- cient than previous solutions and have better properties (constant speed, shortest path and coordinate invariance). For the specific example of skinning, we demonstrate that problems which required considerable research effort recently are trivial to solve using our dual quaternion formulation. However, skinning is only one application of dual quaternions, so several further promising research directions are suggested in the paper.},

To overcome the nonconvex difficulty due to the free-flight time, a minimum-landing-error problem that can be convexified is proposed to serve as a gateway for solving the time-optimal control problem. The proposed method solves the reduced minimum-landing-error problem via convex optimization first and then searches for the minimum flight time through a combination of extrapolation and bisection methods. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology for rapidly generating time-optimal trajectories is validated through simulations of spacecraft landing on two asteroids with both finite thrust and low thrust.},

Space exploration provided the impetus by presenting scientists and engineers with challenging technical problems. The digital computer provided the tool for solving these new problems. The goal of this paper is to review the state of the art in the field loosely referred to as trajectory optimization. Presenting a survey of a field as diverse as trajectory optimization is a daunting task. The author focuses on the two types of methods most widely used today, namely, direct and indirect. I begin the discussion with a brief review of the underlying mathematics in both direct and indirect methods. I then discuss the complications that occur when path and boundary constraints are imposed on the problem description. Finally, I describe unresolved issues that are the subject of ongoing research},

abstract = {One of the main challenges posed by the next space systems generation is the high level of autonomy they will require. Hazard Detection and Avoidance is a key technology in this context. An adaptive guidance algorithm for landing that updates the trajectory to the surface by means of an optimal control problem solving is here presented. A semi-analytical approach is proposed. The trajectory is expressed in a polynomial form of minimum order to satisfy a set of boundary constraints derived from initial and final states and attitude requirements. By imposing boundary conditions, a fully determined guidance profile is obtained, function of a restricted set of parameters. The guidance computation is reduced to the determination of these parameters in order to satisfy path constraints and other additional constraints not implicitly satisfied by the polynomial formulation. The algorithm is applied to two different scenarios, a lunar landing and an asteroidal landing, to highlight its general validity. An extensive Monte Carlo test campaign is conducted to verify the versatility of the algorithm in realistic cases, by the introduction of attitude control systems, thrust modulation, and navigation errors. The proposed approach proved to be flexible and accurate, granting a precision of a few meters at touchdown.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Successive Convexification (SCvx) algorithm to solve a class of non-convex optimal control problems with certain types of state constraints. Sources of non-convexity may include nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state/control constraints. To tackle the challenge posed by non-convexity, first we utilize exact penalty function to handle the nonlinear dynamics. Then the proposed algorithm successively convexifies the problem via a project-and-linearize procedure. Thus a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem is solved at each succession, which can be done efficiently with fast Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers. Global convergence to a local optimum is demonstrated with certain convexity assumptions, which are satisfied in a broad range of optimal control problems. The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for solving trajectory planning problems with collision avoidance constraints. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges reliably after only a few successions. Thus with powerful IPM based custom solvers, the algorithm can be implemented onboard for real-time autonomous control applications.},

The ﬁrst-order necessary conditions are derived and interpreted for a point-mass model with throttle and thrust angle control and for rigid-body model with throttle and angular velocity control, clarifying the characteristics of the minimum-fuel solution in each case. The optimal thrust magnitude proﬁle is bang – bang for both models; for the point-mass, the most general thrust magnitude proﬁle has a maximum – minimum – maximum structure. The optimal thrust direction law for the point-mass model (alignment with the primer vector) corresponds to a singular solution for the rigid-body model. Whether the point-mass solution accurately approximates the rigid-body solution depends on the thrust direction boundary conditions imposed for the rigid-body model. Minimum-fuel solutions, obtained numerically, illustrate the optimal strategies.},

abstract = {The problem of powered descent guidance and control for autonomous precision landing for next-generation planetary missions is addressed. The precision landing algorithm aims to trace a fuel-optimal trajectory while keeping geometrical constraints such as the line of sight to the target site. The design of an autonomous control algorithm managing such mission scenarios is challenging due to fact that critical geometrical constraints are coupled with the translational and rotational motions of the lander spacecraft, leading to a complex motion-planning problem. This problem is approached within the model predictive control framework by representing the dynamics of the rigid body in a uniform gravity field via a piecewise affine system taking advantage of the unit dual-quaternion parameterization. Such a parameterization in turn enables a six-degree-of-freedom motion planning in a unified framework while also admitting a quadratic cost on the required control commands to minimize propellant consumption. A novel feature of the proposed approach is the development of convex representable subsets in the configuration space in terms of unit dual quaternions. The stability and reachability issues of the corresponding piecewise affine model predictive control approach are then discussed. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for autonomous precision landing.},

This paper assumes that the state and control constraints are already convex or convexified, the proposed algorithm convexifies the nonlinear dynamics, via a linearization, in a successive manner. Thus at each succession, a convex optimal control subproblem is solved. Since the dynamics are linearized and other constraints are convex, after a discretization, the subproblem can be expressed as a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem. Since convex optimization problems can be solved very efficiently, especially with custom solvers, this subproblem can be solved in time-critical applications, such as real-time path planning for autonomous vehicles. Several safe-guarding techniques are incorporated into the algorithm, namely virtual control and trust regions, which add another layer of algorithmic robustness. A convergence analysis is presented in continuous- time setting. By doing so, our convergence results will be independent from any numerical schemes used for discretization. Numerical simulations are performed for an illustrative trajectory optimization example.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient method to solve non-convex programming problems with linear equality constraints is presented. The proposed method is based on a recursively feasible and descending sequential convex programming procedure proven to converge to a locally optimal solution. Assuming that the first convex problem in the sequence is feasible, these properties are obtained by convexifying the non-convex cost and inequality constraints with inner-convex approximations. Additionally, a computationally efficient method is introduced to obtain inner-convex approximations based on Taylor series expansions. These Taylor-based inner-convex approximations provide the overall algorithm with a quadratic rate of convergence. The proposed method is capable of solving problems of practical interest in real-time. This is illustrated with a numerical simulation of an aerial vehicle trajectory optimization problem on commercial-of-the-shelf embedded computers.},

The original algorithm was designed to enforce both control and state constraints, including maximum and minimum thrust bounds, maximum speed limits and descent within a glideslope cone (surface impact avoidance). The thrust bounds are non-convex, so the original formulation developed a lossless convexification of these constraints. Likewise, thrust pointing constraints are non-convex. In this paper we present a relaxation for the thrust pointing constraint such that the enhanced PDG algorithm generates a lossless convexification for both the thrust bound and thrust pointing constraints. Pointing constraints are needed for onboard terrain-relative sensors that have specific field-of-view requirements during landing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, E-flow American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). All rights reserved. In this paper, we present a model predictive control (MPC) approach for powered descent guidance and control synthesis in the presence of line of sight and glide slope constraints. The design of an autonomous control algorithm for such a mission scenario is challenging due to fact that the constraints are coupled with rotational and translational motions of a lander spacecraft, leading to a complex configuration space. We approach this problem by representing the general dynamics of the rigid body in an uniform gravity field as a piece-wise affine system utilizing the unit dual quaternion parameterization. Such a parameterization enables a 6-DOF motion prediction algorithm while also allowing selecting a quadratic cost on the required acceleration commands in order to minimize propellant consumption. The constraints are imposed to ensure that the lander's position and orientation are not violating the constraints. A novel feature of this approach is the development of convex representable subset of unit dual quaternions that correspond to translational and rotational states satisfying predefined types of constraints with respect to a moving body frame. The stability and feasibility issues of the piece-wise affine MPC approach are also discussed. Simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for powered descent guidance.},

annote = {- Interesting approach to solving the min fuel problem. Uses other formulations and their relationships to come up with a good approach to solve the bigger picture guidance problem
- Since the approach is based on optimal control theory, they cannot handle as many constraints as we have. Ultimately is not as useful for initializing a 6-DoF solution as a constraint convex approach.
- Since its 3-DoF, they need Apollo type guidance (sub-optimal) to ensure vertical attitude at touchdown - we do not.
- Some really good nuggets in here. I like their approach to proving the optimal solution is bang-bang for 3-DoF, though it is less general than the original lossless proof.
- Possibly work in the variable gravity solution they use
- Good scaling technique - should adapt something similar?
- Really understand PDI approach and why ours is different},

@article{Mao2018,
abstract = {This paper presents the SCvx algorithm, a successive convexification algorithm designed to solve non-convex optimal control problems with global convergence and superlinear convergence-rate guarantees. The proposed algorithm handles nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state and control constraints by linearizing them about the solution of the previous iterate, and solving the resulting convex subproblem to obtain a solution for the current iterate. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates several safe-guarding techniques into each convex subproblem, employing virtual controls and virtual buffer zones to avoid artificial infeasibility, and a trust region to avoid artificial unboundedness. The procedure is repeated in succession, thus turning a difficult non-convex optimal control problem into a sequence of numerically tractable convex subproblems. Using fast and reliable Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers, the convex subproblems can be computed quickly, making the SCvx algorithm well suited for real-time applications. Analysis is presented to show that the algorithm converges both globally and superlinearly, guaranteeing the local optimality of the original problem. The superlinear convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of optimal control problems, showcasing the superior convergence rate that can be obtained by leveraging specific problem properties when compared to generic nonlinear programming methods. Numerical simulations are performed for an illustrative non-convex quad-rotor motion planning example problem, and corresponding results obtained using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver are provided for comparison. Our results show that the convergence rate of the SCvx algorithm is indeed superlinear, and surpasses that of the SQP-based method by converging in less than half the number of iterations.},

This paper represents an attempt to apply second-order cone programming, a branch of convex optimization, to the class of highly nonlinear trajectory optimization problems in entry flight. The foremost challenge in applying convex optimization in most aerospace engineering problems lies in the nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the problem. Exclusive reliance on linearization does not always work well, as is the case in entry trajectory optimization. This paper focuses on how to formulate realistic, highly constrained entry trajectory optimization problems in a fashion suitable to be solved by second-order cone programming with a combination of successive linearization and relaxation techniques. Rigorous analysis is conducted to support the soundness of the approach. Numerical demonstrations are provided to show the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper presents a convex optimizations-based method to compute the set of initial conditions from which a given landing accuracy to a target can be achieved (constrained controllability set) and the set of states that can be reached from a given set of initial states (constrained reachability set) for a planetary landing vehicle with all the relevant controlandmission constraints.Theproposedmethodis basedonthe lossless convexification of the powered- descent landing guidance problem and methods of convex optimization and computational geometry. These techniques are used to generate approximations that can be arbitrarily close to the actual reachability or controllability sets.Thequantification of these sets allows evaluation of the feasibility of aprescribed landing accuracy for a given vehicle andanexpected set of dispersions from the parachute descent phase of a planetary landing mission. Since these sets are generated systematically andquickly, a wide range of design options can be evaluated for different mission requirements. Consequently, the proposed methodcan enable lander vehicle design optimization as a reliable analysis tool for systematic design and system engineering. Nomenclature},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the development of an Interior Point Method (IPM) solver for Second Order Cone Programming optimization problems that is capable of producing customized ANSI-C code for embedded, real-time applications. The customized code is generated for a given problem structure and makes use of no dynamic memory allocation, minimizes branching, wastes no mathematical or logical computations, and has minimal dependencies to standard libraries. The resulting software is designed to be easy to implement on embedded hardware with limited computing capabilities, while still providing accurate results rapidly enough for real-time use. The core IPM algorithm is a fairly standard primal-dual IPM, which makes use of Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scalings and Newton search directions. We make use of the Approximate Minimum Degree heuristic to maximize the sparsity of the Cholesky factorizations that are ultimately used to solve for the search directions. We conclude the paper by presenting the computational performance results from two example problems: a Mars landing optimal control problem and a reaction wheel allocation problem. The code generated for the Mars landing problem was successfully validated in three flights onboard a NASA test rocket, and was used in real-time to generate the optimal landing trajectories that guided the rocket. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that a real-time embedded convex optimization algorithm was used to control such a large vehicle, where mission success and safety critically relied on the real-time optimization algorithm.},

The Entry Terminal Point Controller guidance algorithm is derived from the final phase Apollo Command Module guidance and, like Apollo, modulates the bank angle to control the range flown. For application to Mars landers which must make use of the tenuous Martian atmosphere, it is critical to balance the lift of the vehicle to minimize the range error while still ensuring a safe deploy altitude. An overview of the process to generate optimized guidance settings is presented, discussing improvements made over the last nine years. Key dispersions driving deploy ellipse and altitude performance are identified. Performance sensitivities including attitude initialization error and the velocity of transition from range control to heading alignment are presented.},

abstract = {To increase the science return of future missions to Mars and to enable sample return missions, the accuracy with which a lander can be delivered to the Martian surface must be improved by orders of magnitude. The prior work developed a convex-optimization-based minimum-fuel powered-descent guidance algorithm. In this paper, this convex-optimization-based approach is extended to handle the casewhenno feasible trajectory to the target exists. In this case, the objective is to generate the minimum-landing-error trajectory, which is the trajectory that minimizes the distance to the prescribed target while using the available fuel optimally. This problem is inherently a nonconvex optimal control problem due to a nonzero lowerboundonthe magnitude of the feasible thrust vector. It isfirst proven that an optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem is also optimal for the original nonconvex problem, which is referred to as a lossless convexification of the original nonconvex problem. Then it is shown that the minimum-landing-error trajectory generation problem can be posed as a convex optimization problem and solved to global optimality with known bounds on convergence time. This makes the approach amenable to onboard implementation for real-time applications. Nomenclature},

abstract = {Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars. The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem.},

The existence of an optimal (minimal fuel) thrust program for the problem is then assured by appealing to existence theorems for time optimal controls, and the optimal thrust program is developed by application of the Pontryagin maximum principle. It is shown that the optimal thrust program consists of either full thrust from the initiation of the mission until touchdown, or a period of zero thrust (free-fall) followed by full thrust until touchdown. An approximate switching function which is adequate for a large number of cases is derived, and a preliminary system design is presented. View full abstract},

This paper presents a general and rigorous methodology and algorithmic procedure toward this goal with a target vehicle that can be in an arbitrary orbit. The rendezvous and proximity operations problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, subject to various state and control inequality constraints and equality constraints on interior points and terminal conditions. By a lossless relaxation technique, a relaxed problem is formed, the solution of which is proven to be equivalent to that of the original rendezvous and proximity operations problem. The relaxed problem is then solved by a novel successive solution process, in which the solutions of a sequence of constrained subproblems with linear, time-varying dynamics are sought.
